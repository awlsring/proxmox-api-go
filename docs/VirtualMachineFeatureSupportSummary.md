# VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**HasFeature** | **float32** | An integer used to represent a boolean. 0 is false, 1 is true. | 
**Nodes** | **[]string** |  | 

## Methods

### NewVirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary

`func NewVirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary(hasFeature float32, nodes []string, ) *VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary`

NewVirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary instantiates a new VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewVirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummaryWithDefaults

`func NewVirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummaryWithDefaults() *VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary`

NewVirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummaryWithDefaults instantiates a new VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetHasFeature

`func (o *VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary) GetHasFeature() float32`

GetHasFeature returns the HasFeature field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetHasFeatureOk

`func (o *VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary) GetHasFeatureOk() (*float32, bool)`

GetHasFeatureOk returns a tuple with the HasFeature field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetHasFeature

`func (o *VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary) SetHasFeature(v float32)`

SetHasFeature sets HasFeature field to given value.


### GetNodes

`func (o *VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary) GetNodes() []string`

GetNodes returns the Nodes field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetNodesOk

`func (o *VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary) GetNodesOk() (*[]string, bool)`

GetNodesOk returns a tuple with the Nodes field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetNodes

`func (o *VirtualMachineFeatureSupportSummary) SetNodes(v []string)`

SetNodes sets Nodes field to given value.
